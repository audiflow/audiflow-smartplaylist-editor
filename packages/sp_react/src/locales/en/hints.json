{
  "patternId": "A unique slug identifying this pattern config (e.g., 'my-podcast'). Used as the folder name in the config repository.",
  "podcastGuid": "The podcast's globally unique identifier from its RSS feed. When set, this takes priority over feed URL matching for more reliable identification.",
  "feedUrls": "One or more RSS feed URLs that identify this podcast. The app matches incoming feeds against these URLs to determine which pattern config to apply.",
  "yearGroupedEpisodes": "When enabled, the main episode list in the app groups episodes by their publication year with year headers.",
  "playlistId": "A unique slug for this playlist within the pattern (e.g., 'season-1'). Used as the filename in the config repository.",
  "displayName": "The name shown to users in the app. Choose something descriptive like 'Seasons' or 'Story Arcs'.",
  "resolverType": "Determines how episodes are grouped into this playlist. Each resolver uses a different strategy to organize episodes.",
  "resolverType_rss": "RSS Metadata: Groups episodes by their season number from RSS feed metadata. Best for podcasts that properly tag seasons in their feed (e.g., itunes:season).",
  "resolverType_category": "Category: Groups episodes by matching their titles against regex patterns you define in the 'groups' section. Use when episodes follow naming conventions like 'Arc 1: ...' or 'Mystery Series: ...'.",
  "resolverType_year": "Year: Groups episodes by their publication year. Good for long-running podcasts where yearly grouping is a natural fit.",
  "resolverType_titleAppearanceOrder": "Title Appearance Order: Groups episodes by a recurring pattern in their titles, ordered by when each pattern first appears in the feed. Useful for podcasts with titled story arcs or series.",
  "priority": "Controls the order in which playlists claim episodes. Lower numbers are processed first and claim matching episodes, excluding them from later playlists. Playlists with filters (title/exclude/require) are always processed before filter-less fallback playlists, regardless of priority. Example: if playlist A (priority 0) and B (priority 10) both match an episode, A claims it and B won't see it.",
  "titleFilter": "A regex pattern to include episodes. Only episodes whose title matches this pattern are considered for this playlist. Leave empty to include all episodes.",
  "excludeFilter": "A regex pattern to exclude episodes. Episodes whose title matches this pattern are removed, even if they matched the title filter. Useful for filtering out trailers or bonus content.",
  "requireFilter": "A stricter regex that episodes must match to be included. Unlike title filter, this is applied after grouping and removes non-matching episodes from each group.",
  "episodeYearHeaders": "When enabled, episode lists within this playlist show year separator headers, helping users orient themselves in long episode lists.",
  "showDateRange": "When enabled, each group card displays the date range of its episodes (earliest to latest), giving users a quick sense of the group's timespan.",
  "showSortOrderToggle": "When enabled, explicitly shows a sort order toggle in the app regardless of yearHeaderMode. The initial sort order derives from the first customSort rule.",
  "contentType": "Controls the output shape. 'episodes' creates flat playlists; 'groups' creates nested group structures within each playlist.",
  "nullSeasonGroupKey": "Routes episodes with null or zero season numbers into this group key. For example, set to 999 to collect special episodes in a 'Season 999' group.",
  "groupId": "Unique identifier for this group within the playlist. Used as the internal key.",
  "groupDisplayName": "The name shown to users for this group in the app.",
  "groupPattern": "A regex matched against episode titles. Episodes matching this pattern are assigned to this group. Leave empty to create a catch-all group for unmatched episodes.",
  "customSort": "Override the default sort order for playlists. Simple mode sorts by one field; composite mode allows multi-level sort rules with conditions. Only takes effect when content type is 'groups'. Has no effect in episodes mode.",
  "sortField": "The field to sort playlists by. 'playlistNumber' uses the group key, 'newestEpisodeDate' uses the latest episode date, 'progress' uses listening progress, 'alphabetical' sorts by display name. Note: 'progress' is mobile-only and has no effect in web preview.",
  "sortOrder": "Ascending (A-Z, oldest first, lowest number first) or descending (Z-A, newest first, highest number first).",
  "sortCondition": "When enabled, this sort rule only applies to playlists whose sortKey exceeds the given threshold value.",
  "titleExtractor": "Extracts a display name from episode data for use as group/playlist titles. Supports regex capture groups, templates, and recursive fallback chains. Not used by the Category resolver, which uses static display names from group definitions.",
  "titleExtractorSource": "The episode field to extract from: title, description, seasonNumber, or episodeNumber.",
  "titleExtractorPattern": "A regex applied to the source value. Use capture groups to extract portions of the text.",
  "titleExtractorGroup": "Which regex capture group to use (0 = full match, 1 = first group, etc.).",
  "titleExtractorTemplate": "A template string with {value} placeholder. For example, 'Season {value}' turns '1' into 'Season 1'.",
  "titleExtractorFallbackValue": "A static string returned when all extraction steps fail and the episode has no season number.",
  "episodeExtractor": "Extracts season and episode numbers from episode titles or descriptions. Supports primary and fallback patterns, nullable season extraction (episode-only mode), and RSS metadata fallback.",
  "episodeExtractorSource": "The episode field to extract from: title or description.",
  "episodeExtractorPattern": "A regex with capture groups for season and/or episode numbers.",
  "episodeExtractorSeasonGroup": "Which capture group contains the season number. Leave empty to skip season extraction (episode-only mode).",
  "episodeExtractorEpisodeGroup": "Which capture group contains the episode number (default: 2).",
  "episodeExtractorFallbackSeason": "Season number to assign when only the fallback pattern matches (e.g., 0 for special episodes).",
  "episodeExtractorFallbackPattern": "A secondary regex tried when the primary pattern doesn't match. Used for catching special/bonus episodes.",
  "episodeExtractorFallbackCaptureGroup": "Which capture group in the fallback pattern contains the episode number (default: 1).",
  "episodeExtractorFallbackToRss": "When no pattern matches, use the episode number from RSS metadata instead. Useful as a last-resort fallback.",
  "yearHeaderMode": "Controls year header display within this playlist. 'none' disables headers, 'firstEpisode' shows the year of the first episode, 'perEpisode' shows year headers throughout."
