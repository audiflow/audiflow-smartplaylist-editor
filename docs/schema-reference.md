## Three-Level Hierarchy

Configuration data is organized in a three-level file hierarchy:

```
patterns/
  meta.json                          # Level 1: Pattern Index
  {patternId}/
    meta.json                        # Level 2: Pattern Meta
    playlists/
      {playlistId}.json              # Level 3: Playlist Definition
```

**Level 1 -- Pattern Index** (`patterns/meta.json`): Root index listing all available patterns. The app fetches this first and uses `feedUrlHint` for fast pre-filtering.

**Level 2 -- Pattern Meta** (`{patternId}/meta.json`): Per-podcast metadata containing feed URLs for matching and an ordered list of playlist IDs.

**Level 3 -- Playlist Definition** (`{patternId}/playlists/{playlistId}.json`): Individual playlist configuration defining how episodes are filtered, grouped, and displayed.

---

## Pattern Index

**File:** `patterns/meta.json`

**Schema:** `https://audiflow.app/schema/v5/pattern-index.json`

Root index of all patterns. The app fetches this file first and compares `dataVersion` to detect changes.

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `dataVersion` | integer | yes | Monotonically increasing. Bumped by CI when any pattern changes. |
| `schemaVersion` | integer | yes | Schema structure version. Bumped when JSON structure changes. |
| `patterns` | array | yes | Summary entries for all patterns. |

### PatternIndexEntry

Each element in the `patterns` array:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | Pattern identifier. See [Pattern ID Derivation](#pattern-id-derivation). |
| `dataVersion` | integer | yes | Mirrors `{id}/meta.json` dataVersion for stale-cache detection. |
| `displayName` | string | yes | Human-readable podcast name for admin/editor UIs. |
| `feedUrlHint` | string | yes | Substring of the feed URL for fast pre-filtering. |
| `playlistCount` | integer | yes | Number of playlist definitions in this pattern. |

### Example

```json
{
  "dataVersion": 42,
  "schemaVersion": 5,
  "patterns": [
    {
      "id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
      "dataVersion": 7,
      "displayName": "COTEN RADIO",
      "feedUrlHint": "anchor.fm/s/8c2088c",
      "playlistCount": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Pattern Meta

**File:** `{patternId}/meta.json`

**Schema:** `https://audiflow.app/schema/v5/pattern-meta.json`

Per-podcast metadata. The app matches incoming feeds against `podcastGuid` (preferred) or `feedUrls` to find the right config.

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `dataVersion` | integer | yes | -- | Monotonically increasing. Bumped when any file in this pattern changes. |
| `id` | string | yes | -- | Must match the parent directory name. |
| `podcastGuid` | string | no | -- | Podcast's RSS GUID. Takes priority over feed URL matching. |
| `feedUrls` | string[] | yes | -- | One or more RSS feed URLs. Supports host-migration scenarios. |
| `yearGroupedEpisodes` | boolean | no | `false` | Show year headers in the main episode list (independent of playlist grouping). |
| `playlists` | string[] | yes | -- | Ordered list of playlist definition IDs. Determines display order. |

### Example

```json
{
  "dataVersion": 7,
  "id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "podcastGuid": "abc123-def456",
  "feedUrls": [
    "https://anchor.fm/s/8c2088c/podcast/rss"
  ],
  "yearGroupedEpisodes": true,
  "playlists": ["regular", "extras", "shorts"]
}
```

---

## Playlist Definition

**File:** `{patternId}/playlists/{playlistId}.json`

**Schema:** `https://audiflow.app/schema/v5/playlist-definition.json`

Defines how a playlist filters, groups, and displays episodes. The field layout follows the data processing pipeline:

```
episodeFilters   -->  filter episodes before processing
     |
  grouping       -->  organize filtered episodes into groups
     |
  selector       -->  map groups to dropdown entries
     |
  display        -->  control visual presentation
     |--- groupListing    how the group list is arranged
     |--- groupItem       defaults for each group card
     |--- episodeListing  how episodes are arranged within a group
     |--- episodeItem     defaults for each episode row
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique within the pattern. Must match filename (without `.json`). |
| `displayName` | string | yes | Name shown to users in the app. |
| `priority` | integer | no | Default `0`. Lower numbers claim episodes first. Playlists with filters always run before filter-less ones. |

```json
{
  "id": "regular",
  "displayName": "Regular Series",
  "priority": 0
}
```

---

### episodeFilters

Optional. Pre-processing step that includes/excludes episodes before grouping.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `require` | EpisodeFilterEntry[] | Include rules (AND). All rules must match for an episode to be included. |
| `exclude` | EpisodeFilterEntry[] | Exclude rules (OR). Any matching rule rejects the episode. |

**EpisodeFilterEntry**: At least one field required. When multiple fields are specified, all must match (AND).

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `title` | string | Case-insensitive regex matched against episode title. |
| `description` | string | Case-insensitive regex matched against episode description. |

```json
{
  "episodeFilters": {
    "require": [{ "title": "\\[\\d+-\\d+\\]" }],
    "exclude": [
      { "title": "COTEN RADIO\\s*short" },
      { "title": "preview" }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `by` | enum | yes | Grouping method. See [Grouping Methods](#grouping-methods). |
| `discoveryHint` | string | no | Regex for `titleDiscovery` fallback extraction. |
| `numberingExtractor` | object | no | Parses season/episode numbers from titles. See [NumberingExtractor](#numberingextractor). |
| `staticClassifiers` | array | conditional | Group definitions. Required when `by` is `titleClassifier`. See [StaticClassifier](#staticclassifier). |

```json
{
  "grouping": {
    "by": "seasonNumber",
    "numberingExtractor": {
      "source": "title",
      "pattern": "\\[(\\d+)-(\\d+)\\]",
      "seasonGroup": 1,
      "episodeGroup": 2
    }
  }
}
```

**Legacy note:** In v4, `resolverType` was a top-level field and `numberingExtractor` lived at root level. Both are accepted as aliases during migration.

---

### selector

Optional. Controls how groups map to dropdown entries in the app UI. When absent, all groups appear as cards inside a single entry.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `partitionBy` | enum | `"group"`, `"seasonNumber"`, or `"year"`. |
| `titleExtractor` | object | Generates display names for partitioned entries. Used with `seasonNumber` or `year`. See [TitleExtractor](#titleextractor). |

**partitionBy values:**

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `"group"` | Each group becomes its own dropdown entry. |
| `"seasonNumber"` | Groups are organized under season-number entries. |
| `"year"` | Groups are organized under year entries. |
| _(absent)_ | Single entry containing all groups as cards. |

```json
{
  "selector": {
    "partitionBy": "seasonNumber",
    "titleExtractor": {
      "source": "seasonNumber",
      "template": "Season {value}"
    }
  }
}
```

**Legacy note:** Replaces v4 `presentation`. `"combined"` maps to no selector; `"separate"` maps to `{ "partitionBy": "group" }`.

---

### groupListing

      "group": 1,
      "fallbackValue": "Other"
    }
  }

      "group": 1
    }
  }
}
```

**Legacy note:** In v4, this was `episodeList.titleExtractor`.

---

### Legacy v4 Fields

The following top-level fields are accepted as aliases during v4-to-v5 migration. Use v5 equivalents for new configurations.

| Legacy v4 Field | v5 Equivalent | Migration Notes |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| `resolverType` | `grouping.by` | Direct rename. |
| `groups` | `grouping.staticClassifiers` | Direct rename. |
| `numberingExtractor` | `grouping.numberingExtractor` | Moved into grouping block. |
| `presentation` | `selector` | `"combined"` = no selector; `"separate"` = `{ partitionBy: "group" }`. |
| `groupList` | `groupListing` + `groupItem` | Split: collection settings to `groupListing`, item settings to `groupItem`. |
| `groupList.yearBinding` | `groupListing.sectionBy` | Expanded to support multiple sectioning axes. |

| `episodeExtractor` | `grouping.numberingExtractor` | Deprecated v3 alias for `numberingExtractor`. |

---

## Grouping Methods

The `grouping.by` field selects how episodes are organized into groups.

### seasonNumber

Groups episodes by season number from feed metadata or title parsing.

- Season numbers come from `grouping.numberingExtractor` (if configured) or RSS metadata (`itunes:season`).
- Each distinct season becomes a separate group.
- Episodes without a season number are left ungrouped.
- Best for podcasts that tag seasons or use consistent title patterns like `S01E01` or `[62-15]`.

```json
{
  "grouping": {
    "by": "seasonNumber",
    "numberingExtractor": {
      "source": "title",
      "pattern": "\\[(\\d+)-(\\d+)\\]",
      "seasonGroup": 1,
      "episodeGroup": 2,
      "fallbackToRss": true
    }
  }
}
```

### year

Groups episodes by publication year.

- Each distinct year becomes a separate group.
- Best for long-running podcasts where yearly grouping is natural.

```json
{
  "grouping": {
    "by": "year"
  }
}
```

### titleDiscovery

Finds recurring patterns in episode titles and groups by them, in the order they first appear in the feed.

- Uses `groupItem.titleExtractor` to derive group names.
- `grouping.discoveryHint` provides a regex fallback for group extraction.
- Best for podcasts with titled story arcs or recurring guest series.

```json
{
  "grouping": {
    "by": "titleDiscovery",
    "discoveryHint": "[(.+?)\\s*]"
  },
  "groupItem": {
    "titleExtractor": {
      "source": "title",
      "pattern": "[(.+?)\\s*]",
      "group": 1
    }
  }
}
```

### titleClassifier

Groups episodes by matching titles against patterns defined in `grouping.staticClassifiers`.

- Classifiers are evaluated in order; first match wins.
- A classifier without a `pattern` acts as a catch-all for unmatched episodes.
- Group display names come from the classifier's `displayName` (not from `titleExtractor`).
- Requires `grouping.staticClassifiers`.

```json
{
  "grouping": {
    "by": "titleClassifier",
    "staticClassifiers": [
      {
        "id": "main-series",
        "displayName": "Main Series",
        "pattern": "\\[\\d+-\\d+\\]"
      },
      {
        "id": "extras",
        "displayName": "Extras",
        "pattern": null
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Deprecated Aliases

| Alias | Maps To |
|-------|---------|
| `rss` | `seasonNumber` |
| `category` | `titleClassifier` |
| `titleAppearanceOrder` | `titleDiscovery` |

---

## TitleExtractor

Shared type used by `groupItem.titleExtractor`, `episodeItem.titleExtractor`, and `selector.titleExtractor`.

Generates a display name from episode data using a pipeline: read source -> match pattern -> format with template -> fallback on failure.

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `source` | enum | yes | -- | `"title"`, `"description"`, `"seasonNumber"`, or `"episodeNumber"`. |
| `pattern` | string | no | -- | Regex to match against the source value. Use capture groups `()` to extract parts. |
| `group` | integer | no | `0` | Which capture group to use. `0` = entire match, `1` = first group, etc. |
| `template` | string | no | -- | Format string with `{value}` placeholder. |
| `fallback` | TitleExtractor | no | -- | Tried when the current step fails to match. Supports chaining. |
| `fallbackValue` | string | no | -- | Default name when source is `seasonNumber` or `episodeNumber` and the value is missing or zero. Checked before pattern matching. No effect for `title` or `description` sources. |

### Processing Steps

1. Read the value from `source`.
2. If `fallbackValue` is set and source is `seasonNumber`/`episodeNumber` with a missing or zero value, return `fallbackValue`.
3. If `pattern` is set, match against the value and extract the specified `group`.
4. If `template` is set, substitute `{value}` with the extracted text.
5. If any step fails, try the `fallback` extractor (recursive).

### Examples

**Simple template (season labels):**

```json
{
  "source": "seasonNumber",
  "template": "Season {value}",
  "fallbackValue": "Specials"
}
```

**Regex extraction (strip prefix):**

```json
{
  "source": "title",
  "pattern": "#\\d+\\s+(.+?)\\s*$",
  "group": 1
}
```

**Chained fallback:**

```json
{
  "source": "title",
  "pattern": "COTEN RADIO\\s*([^]+?)\\s*\\d+",
  "group": 1,
  "fallback": {
    "source": "title",
    "pattern": "COTEN RADIO\\s*(.+?)\\s*\\d+",
    "group": 1
  },
  "fallbackValue": "Other"
}
```

---

## NumberingExtractor

Shared type used by `grouping.numberingExtractor` and per-classifier overrides in `grouping.staticClassifiers[].numberingExtractor`.

Parses season and episode numbers from episode text using a three-tier approach:

1. **Primary pattern** with capture groups for season and episode.
2. **Fallback pattern** for special episodes with a fixed season number.
3. **RSS feed data** as last resort (episode number only).

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `source` | enum | yes | -- | `"title"` or `"description"`. |
| `pattern` | string | yes | -- | Regex with capture groups for season and episode numbers. |
| `seasonGroup` | integer or null | no | `1` | Capture group index for season number. Set to `null` for episode-only mode. |
| `episodeGroup` | integer | no | `2` | Capture group index for episode number. |
| `fallbackSeasonNumber` | integer | no | -- | Season number assigned when only the fallback pattern matches. |
| `fallbackEpisodePattern` | string | no | -- | Backup regex tried when the primary pattern does not match. |
| `fallbackEpisodeCaptureGroup` | integer | no | `1` | Capture group in the fallback pattern for the episode number. |
| `fallbackToRss` | boolean | no | `false` | Use RSS feed episode number when no pattern matches. Episode number only; season is not set. |

### Example

```json
{
  "source": "title",
  "pattern": "\\[(\\d+)-(\\d+)\\]",
  "seasonGroup": 1,
  "episodeGroup": 2,
  "fallbackSeasonNumber": 0,
  "fallbackEpisodePattern": "(\\d+)\\]",
  "fallbackEpisodeCaptureGroup": 1,
  "fallbackToRss": true
}
```

**Processing flow:**

1. Match `pattern` against the source text.
2. If matched, extract season from `seasonGroup` and episode from `episodeGroup`.
3. If not matched and `fallbackEpisodePattern` is set, try it. Assign `fallbackSeasonNumber` as the season.
4. If still no match and `fallbackToRss` is true, use RSS feed episode number.

---

## StaticClassifier

Defines a group within `grouping.staticClassifiers` (required for `titleClassifier` method). In v4, this type was called `GroupDef`.

Each classifier matches episodes by title pattern. Classifiers are evaluated in order; the first matching pattern claims the episode. A classifier without a `pattern` acts as a catch-all for unmatched episodes and should be placed last.

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique identifier within the playlist. |
| `displayName` | string | yes | Name shown to users. Always used as-is (not overridden by `titleExtractor`). |
| `pattern` | string | no | Regex matched against episode titles. Omit to create a catch-all. |
| `groupItem` | object | no | Per-classifier override for group card display. |
| `episodeListing` | object | no | Per-classifier override for episode arrangement. |
| `episodeItem` | object | no | Per-classifier override for episode row display. |
| `numberingExtractor` | object | no | Per-classifier override for number parsing. |

### Per-Classifier Overrides

Each classifier can override playlist-level defaults for display and behavior. Omitted fields inherit from the playlist-level settings.

**Overridable sections:**

| Section | Overridable Fields |
|---------|--------------------|
| `groupItem` | `showDateRange`, `pinToYear` |
| `episodeListing` | `sort` |
| `episodeItem` | `titleExtractor` |
| `numberingExtractor` | All fields (replaces the playlist-level extractor entirely) |

### Example

```json
{
  "grouping": {
    "by": "titleClassifier",
    "staticClassifiers": [
      {
        "id": "main",
        "displayName": "Main Series",
        "pattern": "\\[\\d+-\\d+\\]",
        "groupItem": { "showDateRange": true },
        "episodeListing": {
          "sort": { "field": "episodeNumber", "order": "ascending" }
        },
        "episodeItem": {
          "titleExtractor": {
            "source": "title",
            "pattern": "\\]\\s*(.+)",
            "group": 1
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "extras",
        "displayName": "Extras",
        "pattern": null,
        "groupItem": { "showDateRange": false },
        "episodeListing": {
          "sort": { "field": "publishedAt", "order": "descending" }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Legacy v4 Fields in GroupDef

The v4 `GroupDef` type contained `display` and `episodeList` sub-objects that map to v5 overrides:

| v4 GroupDef Field | v5 StaticClassifier Field |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| `display.showDateRange` | `groupItem.showDateRange` |
| `display.yearBinding` | `groupItem.pinToYear` (for `pinToYear` binding) |
| `episodeList.sort` | `episodeListing.sort` |
| `episodeList.titleExtractor` | `episodeItem.titleExtractor` |
| `episodeList.showYearHeaders` | _(not overridable per-classifier in v5)_ |
| `episodeExtractor` | `numberingExtractor` (deprecated v3 alias) |

---

## Sort Rules

### Group Sort (SortRule)

Used in `groupListing.sort`.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `field` | enum | yes | What to sort by. |
| `order` | enum | yes | `"ascending"` or `"descending"`. |

**Sort fields for groups:**

| `playlistNumber` | Group's number: season number, year, first-appearance index, or group position. |
| `newestEpisodeDate` | Newest episode date in each group. |
| `alphabetical` | Alphabetical by group name. |

```json
{ "field": "playlistNumber", "order": "ascending" }
```

### Episode Sort (EpisodeSortRule)

Used in `episodeListing.sort` and per-classifier `episodeListing.sort`.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `field` | enum | yes | What to sort by. |
| `order` | enum | yes | `"ascending"` or `"descending"`. |

**Sort fields for episodes:**

| Field Value | Description |

### Sort Order Values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `ascending` | A-Z, oldest first, lowest number first. |
| `descending` | Z-A, newest first, highest number first. |

---

## Pattern ID Derivation

Pattern IDs are semi-deterministic, computed at creation time:

1. If `podcastGuid` is available: `md5(podcastGuid)[0:12]`
2. Otherwise: `md5(feedUrls[0])[0:12]`

The ID is a 12-character hex string derived from the MD5 hash. Once created, the ID is stable and used to construct all file paths:

- `{id}/meta.json` -- pattern metadata
- `{id}/playlists/{playlistId}.json` -- playlist definitions

The ID must match across:
- `patterns/meta.json` entry `id`
- `{id}/meta.json` field `id`
- The directory name containing the pattern files
