# Contributing to audiflow

Thank you for considering contributing to the audiflow project! This document
explains how to contribute to any repository in the audiflow ecosystem.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

All contributors must sign our [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md) before
their first pull request can be merged. This is a one-time process.

**Why do we require a CLA?**

The audiflow project uses AGPL-3.0 for code and CC BY-SA 4.0 for data. The CLA
ensures that the project maintainer can continue to offer the project under these
licenses and, in the future, potentially under additional commercial licenses.
Without a CLA, every contributor retains copyright over their contributions,
making it legally impossible to change licensing terms -- even when doing so would
benefit the project and its community.

The CLA does NOT transfer your copyright. You retain ownership of your
contributions. It grants the project a broad license to use your contributions
in a way that keeps the project sustainable long-term.

**How to sign:**

1. Submit your pull request
2. A bot will comment asking you to sign
3. Reply with: `I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA`
4. Done! This applies to all future contributions across audiflow repos
